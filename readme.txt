1. @ 'Network.py' :
    - difficulty in merging hidden output of LSTM of character inputs with word embeddings.
    - char_embed_list + word_embeds
    - problem occurs firstly in char_embed_list.
        - how to make an empty Variable type list.
        - how to add elements to that list.
    - Finally, how to put that results into the word embedding list.
